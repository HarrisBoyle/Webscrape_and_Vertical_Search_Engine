Welcome to this repository which showcases web scraping and the construction of a vertical search engine.

## Overview

In the digital age, the ability to extract meaningful data from the web is not just a skill, but a necessity. This repository houses a Jupyter notebook that houses the basics of web scraping. Once we've gathered our data, we venture into the realm of vertical search engines, creating a specialised tool that searches within a specific segment of online content.
